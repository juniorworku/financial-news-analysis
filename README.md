# Financial News Analysis

## Overview
Financial News Analysis is a project aimed at analyzing a large corpus of financial news data to uncover insights related to sentiment, topics, and publisher behavior. The project leverages data engineering, natural language processing (NLP), and statistical analysis techniques to extract valuable information from financial news articles and correlate it with stock market movements.

## Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:


## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
  -echo "# Financial News Analysis" >> README.md
  git init
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "first commit"
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/juniorworku/financial-news-analysis.git
  git push -u origin main
2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```
  python3 -m venv venv
  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
  # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:


4. **Create a New Branch for Task 1**:
# Ensure you are in the main project directory
cd financial-news-analysis

# Create a new branch named "task-1"
git checkout -b task-1


## CI/CD Setup
The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow file (`main.yml`) is located in the `.github/workflows/` directory. The workflow runs tests on every push to the main and task-1 branches.

5. **Run the Code**:
- Execute the main scripts or Jupyter notebooks located in the `src/` and `notebooks/` directories.

## Project Tasks
The project tasks include:
- Setting up Python environment and Git version control
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the financial news dataset
- Conducting sentiment analysis and topic modeling on news headlines
- Analyzing time series data to identify trends in publication frequency and publishing times
- Investigating publisher behavior and contribution to the news feed
